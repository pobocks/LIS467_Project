<h2>Beyond Books</h2>
<p><strong>Community ArtShare Program  provides a place for local artists and collectors to display their work.</strong>. </p>

<p>We encourage a wide variety of original artistry, such as painting, drawing, ceramics, metals, fiber art, photography, needlework, woodworking and carving. Collections may include almost anything that would be of interest to the general public: antiques, seasonal items, instruments, sports memorabilia, costumes, quilts, toys, etc. Our intent is to appeal to a broad audience. </p>

<p><strong>Displays featuring one or more artists or collectors are featured each month on an ongoing basis.</strong> </p>


<p>T.B. Scott Library's "Beyond Books: Community ArtShare" program is made possible by a &#36;10,000 grant from the <em> Mead Witter Foundation, Inc. </em></p>
